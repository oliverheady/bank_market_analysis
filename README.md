# Bank Market Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains the Bank Market Analysis project, which focuses on predicting customer subscription behavior for a bank's new product using Decision Trees and Random Forests. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, optimization, and evaluation.

## Files Description
- `bank_market_analysis.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the project's analysis, including data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `bank-full.csv`: Dataset file containing customer information used for the analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required to run the notebook.

## Installation
To set up the project environment:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repo-link]`
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
Open the Jupyter notebook `bank_market_analysis.ipynb` to view the project. Run each cell to reproduce the analysis.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Initial data setup and cleaning.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Insights and patterns in the data.
3. **Model Building**: Construction of Decision Trees and Random Forest models.
4. **Model Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning for model improvement.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using statistical metrics.
